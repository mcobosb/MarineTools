Data is available from 1749 (Source: [WDC-SILSO](\\href{http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles), Royal Observatory of Belgium, Brussels). The signal contains the well-known 11 years Schwabe cycle, the 22 years one and smaller time scales variations described in [[1]](#1). The analysis focus on the detection of these cycles from 22 years down to the seasonal scale. The steps will be the following: \n",

In this example, a piecewise function compound by two models was selected, where a lognorm PM will fit the body and a Gaussian model will fit the upper tail. The percentil matching point is 0.85. As we are looking for larger oscillations, a basis period of 22 years will be set-up.
